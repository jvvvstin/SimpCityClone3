# SimpCity
DISCLAIMER: This is an assignment done during the course of the DevOps module at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.

We are a group of students from Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Information Technology. This game is called Simp City, that is a city-building strategy game is played over 16 turns. In this game, the player is the mayor of Simp City, and wants to build the happiest and most prosperous city possible, i.e., score the most points. In each turn, the player will build one of two randomly-selected buildings in your 4x4 city. 

In the first turn, the player can build anywhere in the city. In subsequent turns, you can only build on squares that are
connected to existing buildings. The other building that you did not build is discarded. Each building scores in a different way. The objective of the game is to build a city that scores as many points as possible.

There are 5 types of buildings, with 8 copies of each:
• Beach (BCH): Scores 3 points if it is built on the left or right side of the city, or 1 point
otherwise
• Factory (FAC): Scores 1 point per factory (FAC) in the city, up to a maximum of 4
points for the first 4 factories. All subsequent factories only score 1 point each.
• House (HSE): If it is next to a factory (FAC), then it scores 1 point only. Otherwise, it
scores 1 point for each adjacent house (HSE) or shop (SHP), and 2 points for each
adjacent beach (BCH).
• Shop (SHP): Scores 1 point per different type of building adjacent to it.
• Highway (HWY): Scores 1 point per connected highway (HWY) in the same row.
